"""Generic, multi-experiment burned-area spatial-structure and descriptive
comparison audit ("the advisor's third diagnostic").

Scientific purpose
===================
For every resolved experiment, describes the frozen canonical Step8A
500 m modeling dataset's burned cells purely DESCRIPTIVELY:
    - number of 8-neighbour spatially connected burned-cell components
      ("spatially connected burned-cell components" -- NEVER "number of
      fires"; see LIMITATIONS below);
    - component/patch cell-count size distribution;
    - burned-cell elevation distribution;
    - burned-cell land-cover composition (reusing the canonical ESA
      WorldCover mapping already defined in
      src/step8a_prepare_500m_modeling_dataset.py).

This module:
    - NEVER fits a model, computes transfer performance, or reruns
      Step9/Step9G/Step10;
    - NEVER modifies Step8A (read-only input);
    - NEVER hard-codes an experiment ID, AOI name, or region -- every
      public function takes `experiment_id` as an ordinary string and
      resolves paths/registry membership through core.regions only;
    - is order-invariant: the analysis ID for a multi-experiment
      comparison does not depend on the order experiment IDs were
      supplied in.

LIMITATIONS (must appear in every generated report):
    "Connected components are a spatial fragmentation proxy. They must
    not be interpreted as a definitive count of independent wildfire
    events, because one event may appear as multiple disconnected
    components and multiple events may be spatially connected at the
    analysis resolution."
Additional limitations recorded in every manifest/report:
    - connected-component count is resolution-dependent;
    - results are sensitive to AOI clipping;
    - MCD64A1-scale cells are approximate spatial units;
    - component count is not a definitive fire-event count;
    - results are descriptive and do not explain transfer causally.

    Both branches are shared verbatim by src/domain_classifier_audit.py,
    which imports this resolver rather than filtering in parallel.

    `allow_superseded_sensitivity` (default False -- every existing caller,
    including src/domain_classifier_audit.py, keeps the exact previous
    behaviour) narrowly permits ONE thing: pairing a superseded legacy AOI
    variant with its canonical successor as a descriptive AOI-definition
    sensitivity comparison. It is fail-closed in every other direction:
        * with `all_enabled=True` it is an error, never a filter change --
          the discovery cohort is exactly what it was before;
        * a permitted superseded ID must have its registry `superseded_by`
          successor present in the SAME explicit request, and that successor
          must itself validate as a canonical variant;
        * requesting the permission without any superseded ID in the
          selection is an error, so an unnecessary special permission can
          never be granted silently;
        * `--force` never reaches this decision: it only governs overwriting
          outputs whose analysis_id differs, long after resolution.
    A permitted selection is reported as
    selection_mode="explicit_superseded_sensitivity" and carries the
    (superseded, successor) pairs, so every downstream artifact records that
    the legacy variant was a comparator, not a cohort member.
